# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm **Veronica**, a Front-End Developer based in Seattle, Washington, with 8+ years of experience in web development. I specialize in building sleek, responsive websites and have recently been focusing on Web3 technologies.

- Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into **Solana** and **blockchain development** while continuing to work with **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Next.js**.
- In my free time, I create **AI-generated art**, train custom models in **Stable Diffusion**, and explore new front-end technologies to push the boundaries of modern web design.
- I love designing **aesthetically pleasing user interfaces** that are both functional and delightful to use.
- My goal is to bridge the gap between **art and technology**, with a particular focus on creating **user-centric Web3 experiences**.
- Always open to collaborating on innovative projects that fuse **creativity** with **cutting-edge technology**.
